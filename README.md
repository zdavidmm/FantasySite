# Fantasy Site

This repository contains a simple fantasy baseball challenge site that helps run
a "runs 0â€“13" competition. Participants are randomly assigned MLB teams and the
site tracks which run totals each team achieves throughout the season.
The user interface is built with React and styled with a dark theme reminiscent
of DraftKings.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare a `participants.txt` file with one participant name per line. There
   must be exactly 30 participants.

3. Run the draft to assign each participant a random team and initialize the
   scoreboard:
   ```bash
   python draft.py participants.txt
   ```

4. Each day, update the scoreboard with the previous day's results (or pass a
   date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format to fetch another day):
   ```bash
   python update_scores.py            # uses yesterday's date
   python update_scores.py 2025-04-01 # specific date
   ```
   The script pulls scores from the official MLB schedule API and updates
   `scoreboard.json` accordingly.

5. Launch the local web site:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:5000` to view the React interface. The app fetches
   the assignment and scoreboard data from `/api/data` and displays a table in
   a dark theme inspired by DraftKings.

The ultimate goal is for a team to record every run total from 0 through 13.
The sample rules in the project description award prizes for milestones such as
first team to 13 runs, first team to complete all totals, and so on.

## Testing

Automated tests are provided using `pytest`.

1. Install the dependencies (including `pytest`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```

To see detailed debug output while running any of the scripts, set the
`LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG`:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python update_scores.py
```

`draft.py`, `update_scores.py` and `app.py` also respect the optional
`SCOREBOARD_FILE` and `PARTICIPANTS_FILE` environment variables which can be
used to override the default file locations when troubleshooting.
